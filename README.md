# YARA Setup & Automated Scanner (Windows)

This guide walks you through installing **YARA** on Windows, adding it to your environment variables, and setting up a **Python automation script** that continuously scans a folder for suspicious files using custom YARA rules.

---

## Prerequisites

- OS: Windows 10/11
- Python 3.7+
- Git (optional for cloning)

---

##  Step 1: Download & Install YARA (Windows Binary)

1. Download the latest Windows release from the official GitHub repo:  
   üëâ [https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/releases](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/releases)

2. Download the correct version (e.g. `yara-4.5.4-win64.zip` or `yara-4.5.4-win32.zip` depending on your architecture).

3. Extract the zip anywhere, e.g.,  
```

C:\Tools\YARA

```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Add YARA to Windows Environment Variables

So you can run `yara` from any terminal or script:

1. Press `Win + S` and search for **"Environment Variables"**
2. Click **"Edit the system environment variables"**
3. In **System Properties**, click **"Environment Variables..."**
4. Under **System variables**, find and select **`Path`**, then click **Edit**
5. Click **New** and paste the path to the folder with `yara.exe` (e.g.):
```

C:\Tools\YARA

````
6. Click **OK**, **OK**, and **OK** again to save

 Now open **Command Prompt** and run:
```bash
yara -v
````

It should show something like:

```
YARA 4.5.4
```

---

## üìÅ Step 3: Create a Folder for Rules and Test Files

Create a folder like this:

```
üìÅ yara-lab
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ detect_obf_powershell.yar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ suspicious_files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scan_yara.py
```

---

##  Step 4: Example YARA Rule

`rules/detect_obf_powershell.yar`

```yara
rule Detect_Obfuscated_PowerShell
{
    meta:
        author = "Silas"
        description = "Detects obfuscated or suspicious PowerShell commands"
        severity = "high"

    strings:
        $cmd1 = "FromBase64String"
        $cmd2 = "System.Net.WebClient"
        $cmd3 = "DownloadString"
        $cmd4 = "Invoke-Expression"
        $cmd5 = /-e\s+[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{20,}/  // base64 pattern

    condition:
        2 of ($cmd*)
}
```

---

##  Step 5: Python Script for Auto-Scanning

`scan_yara.py`

```python
import os
import time
import subprocess

WATCH_FOLDER = "suspicious_files"
RULE_PATH = "rules/detect_obf_powershell.yar"

def scan_file(file_path):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["yara", RULE_PATH, file_path], capture_output=True, text=True)
        if result.stdout:
            print(f"[!] MATCH FOUND in {file_path}:\n{result.stdout}")
        else:
            print(f"[‚úì] Clean: {file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error scanning {file_path}: {e}")

def main():
    scanned = set()

    print(f"[*] Watching folder: {WATCH_FOLDER}")
    while True:
        for filename in os.listdir(WATCH_FOLDER):
            full_path = os.path.join(WATCH_FOLDER, filename)
            if full_path not in scanned:
                scan_file(full_path)
                scanned.add(full_path)
        time.sleep(3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

##  Running the Script

1. Drop any `.ps1`, `.txt`, or `.bin` file into the `suspicious_files/` folder
2. Run the script:

```bash
python scan_yara.py
```

3. YARA will scan the new file automatically and alert on any rule match

---

##  Test It

1. Create a test PowerShell file like:

   ```powershell
   $b64 = "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="
   $decoded = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($b64))
   Invoke-Expression $decoded
   ```

2. Save it as `test.ps1` inside `suspicious_files/`

3. Your YARA rule should trigger on it

---

## üí° Future Improvements

* Add file hashing (SHA256)
* Save logs to a file
* Integrate this into **BlackVault** for real-time scanning on the backend
